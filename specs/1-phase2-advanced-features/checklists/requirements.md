# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 2 Advanced Features

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: PASS ✅
- Specification focuses on user needs and business value
- No technical implementation details present (no mention of React, FastAPI, specific libraries)
- Written in plain language understandable by product managers and stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness: PASS ✅
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are explicit
- All 32 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-032) are testable with clear criteria
- Success criteria (SC-001 to SC-012) are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentage, count)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no "API response time", no "database query speed" - instead uses user-facing metrics like "Search returns results within 500ms")
- All 10 user stories have defined acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases section identifies 8 boundary conditions with expected behaviors
- Scope is bounded by Phase 2 requirements from hackathon.md
- Dependencies identified: extends existing tasks table, requires browser notification API, needs authentication system

### Feature Readiness: PASS ✅
- Each of 32 functional requirements maps to user stories and success criteria
- User scenarios span all feature tiers (P1: organization/search, P2: recurring/notifications/settings, P3: history/analytics/profile/shortcuts)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable:
  - ✅ Good: "Search returns results within 500ms for task lists up to 1000 items"
  - ✅ Good: "Users can create a task with priority and due date in under 15 seconds"
  - ✅ Good: "90% success rate in usability testing"
- No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan` phase
- All 13 features from user request are addressed across 10 prioritized user stories
- Clear progression from P1 (must-have) → P2 (high-value) → P3 (nice-to-have) enables incremental delivery
- Edge cases cover timezone handling, performance at scale, permission management, and data validation
- Success criteria balance technical performance (response times) with user experience (completion rates, usability metrics)
