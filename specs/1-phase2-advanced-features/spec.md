## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Task Organization with Due Dates and Priorities (Priority: P1)

As a busy user managing multiple tasks, I need to organize my tasks by priority levels and set due dates so that I can focus on what's most urgent and meet my deadlines.

**Why this priority**: Core organizational features that transform the app from a simple list to a productivity tool. These are essential for time management and task prioritization.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating tasks with different priority levels (High/Medium/Low) and due dates, then verifying the visual indicators and date displays work correctly. Delivers immediate value through color-coded visual hierarchy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am creating a new task, **When** I select priority "High" from the dropdown, **Then** the task displays with red color indicator
2. **Given** I am editing a task, **When** I click on the due date field and select tomorrow's date, **Then** the task shows "Due: Tomorrow" label
3. **Given** I have tasks with different priorities, **When** I view my task list, **Then** High priority tasks display with red badge, Medium with yellow badge, Low with green badge
4. **Given** A task is overdue, **When** I view the task list, **Then** the overdue task shows in red with "OVERDUE" label

---

### User Story 2 - Task Categorization with Tags and Search (Priority: P1)

As a user with tasks across different life areas (work, personal, shopping, etc.), I need to tag and search my tasks so that I can quickly find and filter tasks by category.

**Why this priority**: Essential filtering capability that makes the app scalable as task lists grow. Search and tags are fundamental to managing 50+ tasks effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating tasks with tags (e.g., "work", "urgent", "shopping"), then using search and tag filters to verify only matching tasks appear. Delivers value through quick task discovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am creating a task, **When** I type "work meeting" in tag field and press Enter, **Then** a "work" and "meeting" tag appears on the task
2. **Given** I have 20 tasks with various tags, **When** I type "shop" in search box, **Then** only tasks with "shopping" tag or "shop" in title/description appear
3. **Given** I click on a "work" tag on any task, **When** the filter applies, **Then** only tasks with "work" tag are visible
4. **Given** I have applied filters, **When** I click "Clear filters" button, **Then** all tasks become visible again

---

### User Story 3 - Advanced Filtering and Sorting (Priority: P2)

As a user with many tasks, I need to filter by multiple criteria (status, priority, tags, dates) and sort tasks to customize my view and focus on what matters most right now.

**Why this priority**: Enhances P1 features by allowing multi-dimensional organization. Critical for power users but basic task management works without it.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating 30+ tasks with various combinations of status, priority, tags, and due dates, then applying different filter/sort combinations to verify correct results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open the filter menu, **When** I select "High Priority" + "Pending" + "work" tag, **Then** only high-priority pending work tasks appear
2. **Given** I have tasks with different due dates, **When** I select "Sort by Due Date", **Then** tasks display in chronological order (overdue first, then soonest to latest)
3. **Given** Multiple filters are active, **When** I view the filter summary bar, **Then** I see "Filtered by: Priority (High), Status (Pending), Tags (work)" with × buttons to remove each
4. **Given** I select "Sort by Priority", **When** viewing tasks, **Then** High priority tasks appear first, then Medium, then Low, then no priority

---

### User Story 4 - Recurring Tasks Automation (Priority: P2)

As a user with daily/weekly routines, I need tasks to automatically recreate themselves on a schedule so that I don't have to manually re-enter repeating tasks.

**Why this priority**: Automates repetitive work, significantly improving user experience for routine tasks. Requires more complex backend logic but delivers high value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a recurring task (e.g., "Daily standup - Every weekday at 9am"), marking it complete, then verifying a new instance automatically appears the next day with the correct due date.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I create a task "Review email", **When** I set recurrence to "Every day at 8:00 AM", **Then** task shows "↻ Daily" badge
2. **Given** I complete a recurring task today, **When** the next recurrence time arrives, **Then** a new instance of the task appears with tomorrow's due date
3. **Given** I have a "Every Monday" recurring task, **When** I complete Monday's instance, **Then** next Monday's instance appears automatically
4. **Given** I edit a recurring task, **When** I choose "Apply to future instances", **Then** all future occurrences reflect the changes

---

### User Story 5 - Browser Notifications and Reminders (Priority: P2)

As a forgetful user, I need browser notifications to remind me when tasks are due so that I don't miss important deadlines.

**Why this priority**: Proactive reminder system that keeps users engaged. Requires browser permissions but significantly improves task completion rates.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a task with due date "in 5 minutes", granting notification permission, then verifying browser notification appears at the scheduled time with correct task title.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I visit the app for first time, **When** I click "Enable Notifications" in settings, **Then** browser prompts for notification permission
2. **Given** I have notification permission, **When** a task becomes due, **Then** a browser notification appears with task title and "View Task" button
3. **Given** I create a task due in 1 hour, **When** I set reminder for "15 minutes before", **Then** I receive notification 45 minutes from now
4. **Given** I click on a notification, **When** browser opens, **Then** the app opens with that specific task highlighted

---

### User Story 6 - Task History and Activity Log (Priority: P3)

As a user who wants to track my productivity, I need to see a history of all changes made to tasks so that I can review what I accomplished and when.

**Why this priority**: Audit trail and productivity tracking feature. Nice-to-have for accountability but not essential for core task management.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a task, editing it multiple times (title change, status change, priority change), then viewing task history to verify all changes are logged with timestamps and user actions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I create a new task, **When** I view task details, **Then** history shows "Created by [User] at [timestamp]"
2. **Given** I change task title from "A" to "B", **When** I view history, **Then** entry shows "Title changed: 'A' → 'B' at [timestamp]"
3. **Given** I mark task complete, **When** viewing history, **Then** entry shows "Status: Pending → Completed at [timestamp]"
4. **Given** Task has 10 history entries, **When** viewing task panel, **Then** collapsible history section shows all entries in reverse chronological order

---

### User Story 7 - Analytics Dashboard (Priority: P3)

As a goal-oriented user, I need visual charts showing my completion rates, priority distribution, and productivity trends so that I can understand and improve my task management habits.

**Why this priority**: Data visualization for power users. Provides insights but requires completing many tasks first to be useful. Can be added after core features are stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing 50+ tasks over time with varied priorities and due dates, then viewing analytics dashboard to verify charts accurately reflect completion rates, priority distribution pie chart, and trend graphs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I navigate to Analytics page, **When** page loads, **Then** I see completion rate chart (completed vs pending), priority distribution pie chart, and weekly activity graph
2. **Given** I completed 7 tasks this week, **When** viewing weekly chart, **Then** bar graph shows 7 completions for current week
3. **Given** I have 30% High, 50% Medium, 20% Low priority tasks, **When** viewing priority pie chart, **Then** slices accurately represent these percentages
4. **Given** I filter analytics by "Last 30 days", **When** viewing charts, **Then** only tasks created/completed in last 30 days are included in calculations

---

### User Story 8 - User Settings and Preferences (Priority: P2)

As a user who wants a personalized experience, I need to configure theme (dark/light), notification settings, and default task options so that the app matches my workflow.

**Why this priority**: Enhances usability through customization. Theme switching improves accessibility and user satisfaction. Essential for professional app feel.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to Settings, toggling dark mode on/off (verifying UI changes), disabling notifications (verifying no alerts appear), and setting default priority to "High" (verifying new tasks inherit this).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open Settings page, **When** I toggle "Dark Mode" switch, **Then** entire UI immediately switches to dark theme with saved preference
2. **Given** I disable notifications in settings, **When** a task becomes due, **Then** no browser notification appears
3. **Given** I set "Default Priority" to "High", **When** I create a new task without specifying priority, **Then** task automatically has High priority
4. **Given** I change settings, **When** I close and reopen app, **Then** all settings persist (theme, notification preferences, defaults)

---

### User Story 9 - User Profile Management (Priority: P3)

As a user who shares my device, I need to manage my profile (name, email, avatar) and view account details so that I can personalize my identity in the app.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have personalization feature. Improves user experience but not critical for task management functionality. Lower priority than productivity features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to Profile page, uploading a new avatar image (verifying it displays in header), changing name (verifying it updates throughout app), and confirming email update requires re-verification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I navigate to Profile page, **When** I click "Upload Avatar" and select an image, **Then** avatar displays in profile and header navigation
2. **Given** I change my name from "John" to "John Doe", **When** I save, **Then** name updates everywhere in app (header, settings, greetings)
3. **Given** I attempt to change email, **When** I submit new email, **Then** verification email is sent and change pending until confirmed
4. **Given** I view profile, **When** page loads, **Then** I see account creation date, total tasks created, and completion statistics

---

### User Story 10 - Keyboard Shortcuts (Priority: P3)

As a power user who prefers keyboard navigation, I need vim-style shortcuts and quick actions so that I can manage tasks without using the mouse.

**Why this priority**: Efficiency feature for advanced users. Improves speed for those who learn shortcuts but not essential for basic functionality. Can be added incrementally.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the app, pressing `?` to view shortcut help, then testing each shortcut (e.g., `n` creates new task, `j/k` navigate list, `/` focuses search, `x` toggles complete) to verify correct actions execute.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I press `?` key anywhere in app, **When** modal opens, **Then** I see complete list of keyboard shortcuts with descriptions
2. **Given** Task list is visible, **When** I press `n` key, **Then** new task creation modal opens with focus on title field
3. **Given** I am viewing task list, **When** I press `j/k` keys, **Then** selection moves down/up through tasks (vim-style navigation)
4. **Given** A task is selected, **When** I press `x` key, **Then** task completion status toggles (pending ↔ completed)
5. **Given** I press `/` key, **When** search bar appears, **Then** cursor is focused in search input ready to type

### User Story 11 - Import/Export Data (Priority: P2)

As a user who wants data portability and backup, I need to export my tasks to JSON/CSV files and import them back so that I can backup my data, migrate between devices, or integrate with other tools.

**Why this priority**: Essential for data ownership and portability. Users need confidence their data isn't locked in. Enables backup, migration, and integration workflows. Higher priority than profile/analytics as it addresses data security concerns.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating 20 tasks with all fields populated (due dates, priorities, tags, etc.), exporting to JSON and CSV using keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+E), clearing all tasks, then importing each file back and verifying all data restores correctly with proper field mapping.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have tasks in my list, **When** I press `Ctrl+E` or click Export button, **Then** a modal opens with format options (JSON/CSV) and metadata display
2. **Given** I select "Export to JSON" format, **When** export completes, **Then** browser downloads `tasks-export-YYYY-MM-DD.json` with full task data including metadata (exported date, task count, user info)
3. **Given** I select "Export to CSV" format, **When** export completes, **Then** browser downloads `tasks-export-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` with spreadsheet-compatible format (headers: Title, Description, Status, Priority, Due Date, Tags, Created, Updated)
4. **Given** I press `Ctrl+I` or click Import button, **When** modal opens, **Then** I can drag-drop or browse for JSON/CSV files with format auto-detection
5. **Given** I select a valid JSON export file, **When** import completes, **Then** all tasks restore with exact data preservation (due dates, tags, priorities, history)
6. **Given** I import a CSV file with duplicate task titles, **When** conflict detection runs, **Then** I see merge options: "Skip duplicates", "Import as new", or "Update existing"
7. **Given** I import an invalid file, **When** validation fails, **Then** I see clear error message indicating which fields are malformed with line numbers

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user creates a recurring task, completes it, then changes the recurrence pattern? (Should only affect future instances, not historical completions)
- How does system handle tasks with due dates in different timezones when user travels? (Use browser timezone, show relative times like "Due in 2 hours")
- What happens when user revokes notification permission after enabling reminders? (Show warning banner, disable reminder features, allow re-requesting permission)
- How does search handle special characters, emojis, and non-English text? (Full Unicode support, case-insensitive, accent-insensitive matching)
- What happens when analytics dashboard is accessed with fewer than 5 tasks? (Show "Not enough data" message with encouragement to create more tasks)
- How does system handle extremely long tag names (50+ characters)? (Truncate display with ellipsis, show full text on hover)
- What happens when user creates 1000+ tasks? (Implement pagination, virtual scrolling, performance optimization)
- How does recurring task creation handle edge cases like "31st of month" in February? (Skip invalid dates, create on last day of month)
- What happens when importing a JSON file with future schema version? (Show "File from newer version" warning, attempt backward-compatible import, list unsupported fields)
- How does system handle CSV files with missing required columns? (Show validation error listing missing columns, allow partial import if Title column exists)
- What happens when exporting 5000+ tasks? (Stream export in chunks, show progress indicator, generate file asynchronously to prevent browser freeze)
- How does import handle character encoding issues (non-UTF8 CSV)? (Auto-detect encoding, show encoding selection option if detection fails, preview data before import)
