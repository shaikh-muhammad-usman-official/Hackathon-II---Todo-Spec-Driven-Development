# Feature Specification: Phase II - Full-Stack Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `phase-2-fullstack`
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Status**: Implementation Complete
**Input**: Transform Phase I console todo app into production-ready full-stack web application with authentication and persistent storage

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Registration (Priority: P1)

As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can have my own private task list.

**Why this priority**: Without authentication, users cannot have isolated task lists. This is the foundation for multi-user support.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting signup with valid credentials and verifying account creation in database.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the signup page, **When** I enter valid name, email, and password (8+ chars), **Then** account is created and I am redirected to tasks page with JWT token stored
2. **Given** I am on the signup page, **When** I enter an email that already exists, **Then** I see error "Email already registered"
3. **Given** I am on the signup page, **When** I enter password less than 8 characters, **Then** I see validation error

---

### User Story 2 - User Authentication (Priority: P1)

As a registered user, I want to sign in to access my tasks securely.

**Why this priority**: Without signin, returning users cannot access their existing tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting signin with valid/invalid credentials and verifying JWT token generation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have an account, **When** I enter correct email and password, **Then** I receive JWT token and am redirected to tasks page
2. **Given** I have an account, **When** I enter wrong password, **Then** I see error "Invalid email or password"
3. **Given** I am authenticated, **When** I click logout, **Then** my token is cleared and I am redirected to signin page

---

### User Story 3 - Add Task (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to add new tasks so I can track what I need to do.

**Why this priority**: Core CRUD functionality - cannot have a todo app without creating tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a task and verifying it appears in the task list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on tasks page, **When** I enter title and click Add, **Then** task is created and appears in the list
2. **Given** I am on tasks page, **When** I enter title with optional description, **Then** both are saved and displayed
3. **Given** I am on tasks page, **When** I try to add empty title, **Then** I see validation error

---

### User Story 4 - View Tasks (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to view all my tasks so I can see what needs to be done.

**Why this priority**: Users need to see their tasks to manage them.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading tasks page and verifying all user's tasks are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am authenticated, **When** I visit tasks page, **Then** I see all my tasks with title, description, and status
2. **Given** I have tasks, **When** I filter by "Pending", **Then** I see only incomplete tasks
3. **Given** I have tasks, **When** I filter by "Completed", **Then** I see only completed tasks
4. **Given** I have no tasks, **When** I visit tasks page, **Then** I see empty state message

---

### User Story 5 - Update Task (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to edit my tasks so I can correct mistakes or update details.

**Why this priority**: Core CRUD functionality - users need to modify existing tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by editing a task and verifying changes persist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a task, **When** I click edit and change title, **Then** the new title is saved and displayed
2. **Given** I have a task, **When** I update description, **Then** the new description is saved
3. **Given** I am editing, **When** I click cancel, **Then** changes are discarded

---

### User Story 6 - Delete Task (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to delete tasks I no longer need.

**Why this priority**: Core CRUD functionality - users need to remove tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deleting a task and verifying it no longer appears.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a task, **When** I click delete and confirm, **Then** task is removed from database and list
2. **Given** I click delete, **When** confirmation appears, **Then** I can cancel to keep the task

---

### User Story 7 - Mark Task Complete (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to mark tasks as complete to track my progress.

**Why this priority**: Core feature - tracking completion is essential for a todo app.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by toggling task completion and verifying status changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a pending task, **When** I click the checkbox, **Then** task is marked complete with visual indication
2. **Given** I have a completed task, **When** I click the checkbox, **Then** task is marked pending again
3. **Given** I complete a task, **When** I view counts, **Then** pending decreases and completed increases

---

### User Story 8 - User Isolation (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want my tasks to be private so other users cannot see or modify them.

**Why this priority**: Security requirement - multi-user system must isolate data.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating two users and verifying each only sees their own tasks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** User A has tasks, **When** User B logs in, **Then** User B sees only their own tasks (not User A's)
2. **Given** I am User A, **When** I try to access User B's task via API, **Then** I receive 403 Forbidden

### Edge Cases

- What happens when JWT token expires? → User is redirected to signin with "Token expired" message
- What happens when backend is unreachable? → Frontend shows error and allows retry
- What happens with very long task titles? → Title is limited to 200 characters with validation
- What happens on concurrent edits? → Last write wins (no conflict resolution needed for MVP)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to register with name, email, and password
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate email uniqueness during registration
- **FR-003**: System MUST hash passwords before storing (SHA256/bcrypt)
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate JWT tokens on successful authentication
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate JWT tokens on all protected API endpoints
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow authenticated users to create tasks with title (required) and description (optional)
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow authenticated users to view only their own tasks
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow authenticated users to update their own tasks
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow authenticated users to delete their own tasks
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow authenticated users to toggle task completion status
- **FR-011**: System MUST filter tasks by status (all, pending, completed)
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist all data to Neon PostgreSQL database
- **FR-013**: System MUST return task counts (total, pending, completed) with task list

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents registered user - id (UUID), email (unique), name, password_hash, timestamps
- **Task**: Represents todo item - id (serial), user_id (FK to User), title, description, completed (boolean), timestamps
