## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Task Data Model
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: number;              // Auto-generated
  user_id: string;         // From JWT auth
  title: string;           // Required, 1-200 chars
  description?: string;    // Optional, max 1000 chars
  completed: boolean;      // Default: false
  created_at: Date;        // Auto-generated
  updated_at: Date;        // Auto-updated
}
```

### FR-2: Data Isolation
- Users see only their own tasks
- API filters all queries by authenticated user_id
- Frontend never receives other users' tasks

### FR-3: Validation Rules
**Client-side:**
- Title: required, 1-200 characters
- Description: optional, max 1000 characters
- Real-time validation feedback

**Server-side:**
- Same rules enforced
- 400 Bad Request on validation error
- User-friendly error messages

### FR-4: Error Handling
- Network errors: "Network connection lost"
- Validation errors: Specific field messages
- Server errors: "Something went wrong"
- Unauthorized: Redirect to login
- Not found: "Task not found"

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- Task list loads in < 1 second
- CRUD operations complete in < 500ms
- Optimistic UI updates instant (<50ms)

### NFR-2: Usability
- Intuitive UI, self-explanatory
- Clear feedback for all actions
- Keyboard accessible (Tab, Enter)
- Mobile-responsive

### NFR-3: Accessibility
- WCAG AA compliance
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels on icons
- Focus indicators
- Screen reader friendly

### NFR-4: Security
- JWT authentication required
- Input sanitization (XSS prevention)
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- User isolation enforced

---

## Integration Points

### API Endpoints Used
- `POST /api/{user_id}/tasks` - Create
- `GET /api/{user_id}/tasks` - Read list
- `GET /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}` - Read single
- `PUT /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}` - Update
- `DELETE /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}` - Delete
- `PATCH /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}/complete` - Toggle

### Frontend Components
- `TaskForm` - Create tasks
- `TaskList` - Display grid
- `TaskCard` - Individual task
- `StatusBadge` - Visual indicator
- `ConfirmDialog` - Delete confirmation

### State Management
- React state (useState/useContext)
- Optimistic updates
- API sync on mutations

- Recurring tasks (Phase V)
- Due dates (Phase V)
- Priorities (Phase V)
- Tags/categories (Phase V)
- Search/filter (Phase V)
