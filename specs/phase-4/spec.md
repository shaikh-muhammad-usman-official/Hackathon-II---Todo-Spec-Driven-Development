## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Containerize Application (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to containerize the frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI) applications so that they can be deployed consistently across environments.

**Why this priority**: Essential prerequisite for Kubernetes deployment. Without containers, we cannot deploy to Minikube.

**Independent Test**: Build Docker images locally and run them using `docker run` to verify functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the backend source code, **When** I build the Docker image, **Then** it should build successfully and run on port 8000.
2. **Given** the frontend source code, **When** I build the Docker image, **Then** it should build successfully and run on port 3000.
3. **Given** running containers, **When** I access the health endpoint, **Then** it should return healthy status.
4. **Given** the backend container, **When** database credentials are provided, **Then** it should connect to Neon PostgreSQL.

### User Story 2 - Create Helm Charts (Priority: P2)

As a DevOps engineer, I need Helm charts for the application so that deployment is managed, versioned, and reproducible.

**Why this priority**: Standard way to package and deploy applications on Kubernetes. Required for Phase 4.

**Independent Test**: Use `helm template` to verify manifest generation and `helm lint` to check validity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Helm charts, **When** I run `helm lint`, **Then** it should pass without errors.
2. **Given** specific environment values, **When** I run `helm template`, **Then** it should generate correct Kubernetes manifests.
3. **Given** the Helm chart, **When** I include secrets, **Then** sensitive data should be properly encoded.

### User Story 3 - Deploy to Minikube (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want to deploy the full application stack to a local Minikube cluster so that I can test the cloud-native architecture locally.

**Why this priority**: The main deliverable for Phase 4.

**Independent Test**: Run `kubectl get pods` to see running pods and access the application via Minikube IP or tunnel.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running Minikube cluster, **When** I install the Helm release, **Then** frontend and backend pods should reach `Running` state.
2. **Given** deployed services, **When** I access the application URL, **Then** the Chatbot UI should load and respond.
3. **Given** the deployment, **When** I inspect logs, **Then** I should see expected application startup logs.
4. **Given** a health probe request, **When** the backend is healthy, **Then** it should return 200 OK.

### User Story 4 - AI-Assisted DevOps (Priority: P4)

As a developer, I want to use AI tools (kubectl-ai, kagent, Gordon) to assist with Docker and Kubernetes operations so that I can leverage AI for infrastructure management.

**Why this priority**: Bonus requirement for the hackathon to demonstrate AI-assisted DevOps.

**Independent Test**: Document usage of AI tools in PHR/README with command examples.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** kubectl-ai installed, **When** I ask to scale pods, **Then** it should generate the correct scaling command.
2. **Given** kagent installed, **When** I ask for cluster health, **Then** it should analyze and report status.
3. **Given** Gordon available, **When** I ask for Dockerfile help, **Then** it should provide optimization suggestions.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Minikube runs out of resources?
  - Pods go to Pending state; user should increase Minikube resources
- What happens when Docker image build fails?
  - Clear error message with build logs; user fixes source issues
- What happens when database connection fails in container?
  - Readiness probe fails; pod not added to service endpoints
- What happens when secrets are not configured?
  - Application fails to start; error in logs indicates missing env vars

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST be containerized using multi-stage Docker builds.
- **FR-002**: Backend MUST expose `/health` and `/ready` endpoints for Kubernetes probes.
- **FR-003**: Frontend and Backend MUST be deployed as separate Kubernetes Deployments.
- **FR-004**: Helm charts MUST be used for all Kubernetes resource definitions.
- **FR-005**: Secrets MUST be stored in Kubernetes Secrets (not hardcoded).
- **FR-006**: Application MUST be deployable on Minikube with a single Helm command.
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST include complete deployment instructions.
- **FR-008**: AIOps tools (kubectl-ai, kagent) MUST be documented with usage examples.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Docker images MUST build in under 5 minutes each.
- **NFR-002**: Pods MUST reach Running state within 2 minutes of deployment.
- **NFR-003**: Application MUST remain functional under Minikube resource constraints.
- **NFR-004**: Deployment documentation MUST allow new user to deploy in under 30 minutes.

### Key Entities

- **Docker Image**: Container image for Frontend (Node.js) and Backend (Python).
- **Helm Release**: Deployed instance of the todo-app chart.
- **Kubernetes Pod**: Running instance of a containerized service.
- **Kubernetes Service**: Network abstraction exposing pods.
- **Kubernetes Secret**: Encrypted storage for credentials.
