# Feature Specification: Dashboard - Task Management Interface

**Feature Branch**: `1-dashboard`
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Dashboard Feature - User dashboard page showing task statistics, recent tasks, and quick actions with glassmorphism styling, dark theme, progress indicators, and task management interface."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Dashboard Overview (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to see a comprehensive dashboard when I log in so that I can quickly understand my task status and productivity at a glance.

**Why this priority**: The dashboard is the primary interface users interact with after login. Without it, users cannot effectively manage their tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and verifying the dashboard displays task statistics (total, pending, completed), recent tasks, and quick action buttons.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am authenticated, **When** I navigate to /tasks, **Then** I see a dashboard with header showing my name/email and logout button
2. **Given** I have tasks, **When** the dashboard loads, **Then** I see statistics cards showing total tasks, pending tasks, and completed tasks with visual indicators
3. **Given** I have no tasks, **When** the dashboard loads, **Then** I see an empty state with helpful message and prompt to add first task

---

### User Story 2 - Add New Task (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to quickly add new tasks from the dashboard so that I can capture tasks without navigating away.

**Why this priority**: Task creation is core CRUD functionality - the app is useless without ability to add tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by filling the task form and verifying the new task appears in the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the dashboard, **When** I enter a task title and click Add, **Then** the task is created and appears in my task list
2. **Given** I am on the dashboard, **When** I enter a title with optional description, **Then** both are saved and displayed on the task card
3. **Given** I am on the dashboard, **When** I try to add a task with empty title, **Then** I see a validation error

---

### User Story 3 - View and Filter Task List (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to view my tasks and filter them by status so that I can focus on what needs attention.

**Why this priority**: Users need to see and organize their tasks to manage them effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading tasks and using filter buttons to switch between All/Pending/Completed views.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple tasks, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I see all my tasks in a scrollable list
2. **Given** I have tasks, **When** I click the "Pending" filter, **Then** I see only incomplete tasks
3. **Given** I have tasks, **When** I click the "Completed" filter, **Then** I see only completed tasks
4. **Given** I change filters, **When** the list updates, **Then** the statistics bar reflects the current filter context

---

### User Story 4 - Toggle Task Completion (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to mark tasks as complete or incomplete so that I can track my progress.

**Why this priority**: Completion tracking is essential for a todo app - it's how users measure progress.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking a task's checkbox and verifying the status changes visually and in the API.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a pending task, **When** I click the completion checkbox, **Then** the task is marked complete with visual strikethrough
2. **Given** I have a completed task, **When** I click the completion checkbox, **Then** the task is marked pending again
3. **Given** I toggle completion, **When** the update succeeds, **Then** the statistics counters update immediately

---

### User Story 5 - Edit Task (Priority: P2)

As an authenticated user, I want to edit my task details so that I can correct mistakes or update information.

**Why this priority**: Users often need to modify tasks after creation - important but less frequent than viewing/completing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking edit, modifying fields, saving, and verifying changes persist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a task, **When** I click the edit button, **Then** the task card expands to show editable fields
2. **Given** I am editing a task, **When** I change the title and save, **Then** the new title is displayed
3. **Given** I am editing a task, **When** I click cancel, **Then** my changes are discarded and original values shown

---

### User Story 6 - Delete Task (Priority: P2)

As an authenticated user, I want to delete tasks I no longer need so that I can keep my list clean.

**Why this priority**: Deletion is necessary for list maintenance but used less frequently than other operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking delete, confirming, and verifying the task is removed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a task, **When** I click the delete button, **Then** I see a confirmation prompt
2. **Given** I see the delete confirmation, **When** I confirm deletion, **Then** the task is removed from the list and statistics update
3. **Given** I see the delete confirmation, **When** I cancel, **Then** the task remains in the list

---

### User Story 7 - Progress Visualization (Priority: P2)

As an authenticated user, I want to see visual progress indicators so that I can quickly understand my completion rate.

**Why this priority**: Visual progress motivates users and provides quick status understanding.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying progress bar percentage matches completed/total ratio.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have tasks, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I see a progress bar showing completion percentage
2. **Given** I complete a task, **When** the statistics update, **Then** the progress bar animates to the new percentage
3. **Given** I have 0 tasks, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** the progress bar shows 0% or is hidden

---

### User Story 8 - Responsive Design (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want the dashboard to work well on different screen sizes so that I can manage tasks from any device.

**Why this priority**: Mobile accessibility is important but not critical for MVP functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing dashboard at different viewport widths and verifying layout adapts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on a mobile device, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** the layout stacks vertically and remains usable
2. **Given** I am on a tablet, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I see an optimized two-column layout
3. **Given** I am on a desktop, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I see the full layout with sidebar space

### Edge Cases

- What happens when JWT token expires? Users are redirected to signin with "Session expired" message
- What happens when backend is unreachable? Dashboard shows error state with retry button
- What happens with very long task titles? Title is truncated with ellipsis, full title shown on hover
- What happens with rapid consecutive updates? UI uses optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- What happens if task count exceeds viewport? Task list becomes scrollable with fixed header
