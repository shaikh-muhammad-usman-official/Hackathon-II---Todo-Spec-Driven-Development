# Tasks: Dashboard - Task Management Interface

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/1-dashboard/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), data-model.md (complete), contracts/dashboard-api.yaml (complete)

**Tests**: Not required per spec (TDD not explicitly requested for Phase II)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app (this project)**: `backend/` and `frontend/` at repository root
- Backend API: Complete (no backend tasks needed)
- Focus: Frontend dashboard enhancement

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational completion
  - P1 stories (US1-US4) are highest priority
  - P2 stories (US5-US7) follow P1 completion
  - P3 story (US8) follows P2 completion
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Priority | Depends On | Can Start After |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| US1 (Dashboard Overview) | P1 | Foundational | Phase 2 |
| US2 (Add Task) | P1 | Foundational | Phase 2 |
| US3 (Filter Tasks) | P1 | Foundational | Phase 2 |
| US4 (Toggle Completion) | P1 | Foundational | Phase 2 |
| US5 (Edit Task) | P2 | US1-US4 | Phase 6 |
| US6 (Delete Task) | P2 | US1-US4 | Phase 6 |
| US7 (Progress Bar) | P2 | US1-US4 | Phase 6 |
| US8 (Responsive) | P3 | US1-US7 | Phase 9 |

### Within Each User Story

- Component enhancements before integration
- Core implementation before polish
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 2 (Foundational):**
```
T004 (StatsCard) || T005 (ProgressBar) || T006 (verify styles)
```

**P1 Stories (after Foundational):**
```
US1, US2, US3, US4 can be worked in parallel if needed
```

**Polish Phase:**
```
T041 (styling) || T042 (error states)
```

## Notes

- Backend API is complete - no backend tasks needed
- Focus is on frontend dashboard enhancement
- Existing components (TaskForm, TaskList, TaskItem) need enhancement, not rewrite
- New components (StatsCard, ProgressBar) need to be created
- All tasks reference exact file paths per plan.md structure
- Commit after each task or logical group
