# Phase III: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot - Specification

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: Draft
**Constitution**: v1.0.0 Compliant
**Target Points**: 200 (Base) + 600 (Bonus) = **800 Total**

---

## Overview

Transform the Evolution Todo application into an AI-powered conversational interface using **OpenAI ChatKit** (frontend), **OpenAI Agents SDK** (AI logic), and **Official MCP SDK** (tool integration). The chatbot must manage tasks through natural language while maintaining **stateless architecture** with database persistence.

### Key Objectives

1. **Conversational Task Management**: "Add a task to call mom tomorrow" → Task created with due date
2. **Stateless Chat Endpoint**: Server restart must NOT lose conversation context
3. **MCP Tool Architecture**: AI agent uses standardized tools to interact with task system
4. **Multi-Modal Support**: Voice input + Urdu language support (Bonus +300 points)
5. **Advanced Features**: Priorities, tags, due dates, recurring tasks, search (Bonus +300 points)

## User Stories

### US-CHAT-1: Natural Language Task Creation (Priority: P1)

```
As a user
I want to create tasks using natural language
So that I can quickly add todos without clicking through forms
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ User can type: "Remind me to buy groceries tomorrow at 5 PM"
- ✅ AI extracts: title="Buy groceries", due_date="tomorrow 5PM"
- ✅ Task is created in database with proper due date
- ✅ AI confirms: "✅ Added task 'Buy groceries' due tomorrow at 5 PM"
- ✅ Conversation history is persisted to database

**Test Scenarios:**
```
GIVEN I am logged into the chatbot
WHEN I type "Add a task to finish the report by Friday"
THEN AI agent calls add_task MCP tool
AND task is created with title="Finish the report", due_date=<next Friday>
AND AI responds with confirmation message
AND message is saved to database

GIVEN server restarts
WHEN I reload the chat
THEN previous conversation history is loaded from database
AND I can continue the conversation
```
