    Switching from client-side `router.push` to `window.location.href` to force a full browser reload during authentication. This ensures the newly set JWT cookie is properly included in the request header for the Next.js middleware check. Refined middleware logic for better handling of protected vs auth paths.
- OUTCOME: Authentication navigation is now reliable and immediate.
