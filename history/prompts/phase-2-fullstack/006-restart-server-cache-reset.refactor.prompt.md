  - Verified port 3000 process kill
- PROMPT_TEXT: |
    Runtime Error: Cannot find the middleware module (persisting after fix).
- RESPONSE_TEXT: |
    Identified that the "module not found" error was likely due to a stale Next.js cache. Cleared the `.next` directory, killed the existing process on port 3000, and performed a clean restart of the development server.
- OUTCOME: Clean server restart triggered.
