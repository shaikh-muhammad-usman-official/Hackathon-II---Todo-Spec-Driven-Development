## Prompt

User requested Phase II implementation with following requirements from hackathon.md:

**Original Request (Urdu/English Mix):**
```
@hackathon.md ise read karo aur phase 2 main jo jo requirment hain wo ache se pori karo # 🚀 PHASE II - EVOLUTION TODO (EXACT UI MATCH)

@sp.constitution  # Phase 1 reuse
@file:39          # Hackathon specs
https://evolution-todo.vercel.app/  # EXACT UI + THEME COPY
```

**Follow-up Request:**
```
ap phase 2 ki requirment read karo hackathon.md main aur kaam karo

```

**Key Requirements from hackathon.md:**
1. Transform console app into modern multi-user web application
2. Implement all 5 Basic Level features as web application
3. Create RESTful API endpoints (6 total)
4. Build responsive frontend interface
5. Store data in Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
6. Authentication with Better Auth + JWT
7. Use Spec-Driven Development workflow
8. Match EXACT UI from https://evolution-todo.vercel.app/

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 16+ (App Router)
- Backend: Python FastAPI
- ORM: SQLModel
- Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- Auth: Better Auth with JWT
- Spec-Driven: Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus

## Response snapshot

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Read and analyzed hackathon.md Phase II requirements
2. ✅ Created new git branch: `phase-2-fullstack`
3. ✅ Created monorepo folder structure:
   - `.spec-kit/` - Configuration
   - `specs/ui/` - UI design specs
   - `specs/features/` - Feature specs
   - `specs/api/` - API endpoint specs
   - `specs/database/` - Database schema specs
   - `frontend/` - Next.js application
   - `backend/` - FastAPI application
4. ✅ Created comprehensive UI Design Specification (`specs/ui/design.md`) with:
   - Exact color palette (Purple #8B5CF6, Blue #3B82F6)
   - Glassmorphism effect specifications
   - Dark/Light theme toggle details
   - Component specifications (Header, Sidebar, TaskForm, TaskCard, StatusBadge, ThemeToggle)
   - Animation and transition specifications
   - Responsive design breakpoints
   - Accessibility requirements
   - Implementation notes with tech stack

5. ⏳ Started creating Task CRUD feature spec (interrupted by user)
6. ✅ Created Phase II todo list with 14 tasks
7. ✅ Created PHR (this file) to document the interaction

**Spec-Driven Workflow Initiated:**
- Stage: Specification (WHAT to build)
- Next: Planning (HOW to build)
- Then: Tasks (breakdown)
- Finally: Implementation

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Phase II foundation established with monorepo structure and comprehensive UI spec
- 🧪 Tests: None yet (specs stage)
- 📁 Files:
  - Created: specs/ui/design.md (comprehensive UI specification)
  - Created: history/prompts/phase-2-fullstack/ folder
  - Created: This PHR
  - Modified: Branch switched to phase-2-fullstack
- 🔁 Next prompts:
  1. Create specs/overview.md (Phase II project overview)
  2. Create specs/features/task-crud.md (5 basic CRUD features)
  3. Create specs/features/authentication.md (Better Auth + JWT)
  4. Create specs/api/rest-endpoints.md (6 API endpoints)
  5. Create specs/database/schema.md (Neon PostgreSQL schema)
  6. Create .spec-kit/config.yaml
  7. Update root CLAUDE.md for monorepo navigation
- 🧠 Reflection: Following Spec-Driven Development strictly - creating comprehensive specs BEFORE any code. User emphasizes need for PHRs, so documenting all interactions properly.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None yet, in early spec phase
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (specs stage)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Complete all specs before moving to implementation (following SDD principle from constitution)
