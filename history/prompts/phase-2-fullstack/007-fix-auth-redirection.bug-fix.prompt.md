    mera project phase2 achi trhan se dekhain aur errors sahi kr k do signin create account krne pr dashboard open nhi ho raha
- RESPONSE_TEXT: |
    Fixed the issue where the dashboard was unreachable after authentication. The middleware required an `auth_token` cookie for access, but the login pages only set `localStorage`. Added `document.cookie` assignment to the sign-in and sign-up flows and updated logout to clear the cookie.
- OUTCOME: Dashboard redirection loop resolved.
