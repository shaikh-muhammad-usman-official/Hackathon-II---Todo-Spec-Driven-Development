    Restructured the repository by moving Phase I files to a `phase-1/` directory. Created `vercel.json` and a root `package.json` to configure the project as a Next.js + FastAPI monorepo for Vercel deployment. Provided instructions to use the Vercel CLI for the final deployment.
- OUTCOME: Repository organized and deployment configuration ready.
