## Prompt
Failed to create task

## Response
Investigated potential causes for "Failed to create task" error:
1. Verified backend endpoint exists at `POST /api/{user_id}/tasks`.
2. Confirmed frontend API client configuration is correct (Port 8000).
3. Identified potential issues: Authentication (JWT token missing/expired), past due dates, or backend service not running.
4. Advised user to check backend logs and browser console for specific error codes (401 vs 500).

## Outcome
Guided user through troubleshooting steps to resolve connection or validation errors.
