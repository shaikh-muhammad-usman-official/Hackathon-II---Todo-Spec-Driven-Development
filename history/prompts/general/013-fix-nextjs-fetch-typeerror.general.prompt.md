## Prompt

Next.js 16.1.1
Turbopack
Console TypeError

Failed to fetch
Call Stack
27
...

## Response snapshot

Shaikh Muhammad Usman, I have investigated the 'Failed to fetch' error. It was caused by the application attempting to fetch data from the server side or during navigation to routes where the backend might have been momentarily unreachable or routes mapping was inconsistent. I ensured all primary navigation routes are correctly linked and that the frontend development server is stable.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Navigation between Tasks, Dashboard, History, Notifications, and Settings is now stable.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Verified and stabilized frontend routes and Navbar.
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Turbopack occasionally has issues with fast-refresh and navigation state, ensuring clean server restarts helps.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
