    Following the successful previous restructuring where you:
    - Organized Phase I files into a `phase-1/` directory
    - Created `vercel.json` and root `package.json` for Next.js + FastAPI monorepo deployment on Vercel
    - Provided Vercel CLI deployment instructions

    Please restructure the complete project with all phases (Phase 1, 2, 3, and any additional phases) into a production-ready monorepo structure optimized for Vercel deployment. Include:

    1. Organized directory structure for all phases (`phase-1/`, `phase-2/`, `phase-3/`, etc.)
    2. Root-level configuration files (`package.json`, `vercel.json`)
    3. Backend/frontend separation for FastAPI + Next.js deployment
    4. Step-by-step Vercel CLI deployment instructions
    5. Any necessary environment configurations

    Ensure the structure maintains separation of concerns while enabling seamless Vercel deployment.
- RESPONSE_TEXT: |
    Completed a comprehensive restructuring of the repository into a multi-phase monorepo. Phase 2 (frontend/backend) was organized into a dedicated directory. Root configurations (`vercel.json`, `package.json`) were optimized for nested Vercel builds. Added environment variable templates and updated the root README with consolidated deployment instructions.
- OUTCOME: Production-ready monorepo structure with clear multi-phase separation and optimized Vercel deployment paths.
