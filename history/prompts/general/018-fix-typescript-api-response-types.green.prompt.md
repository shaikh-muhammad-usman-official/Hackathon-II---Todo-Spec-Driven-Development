## Response snapshot

Analyzed the TypeScript build failure and identified multiple type mismatches between frontend API client and backend responses:

1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Backend returns objects with nested arrays (e.g., `{ history: [...], count: n }`)
   - Frontend API client incorrectly typed to return arrays directly (`Promise<any[]>`)
   - TypeScript infers `never` type when defensive checks try to access properties on what should be an array

2. **Fixes Applied:**
   - Created proper TypeScript interfaces for backend responses (`HistoryResponse`, `NotificationsResponse`)
   - Updated API client method return types to match actual backend responses
   - Fixed frontend pages to use correct response structure (`data.history` instead of defensive Array.isArray check)
   - Corrected Notification model fields to match backend schema (`sent` vs `read`, `notification_type` vs `title`)
   - Fixed incorrect lucide-react import (`CheckCheck` vs non-existent `CheckAll`)
   - Added helper functions to format notification data from backend schema

3. **Files Modified:**
   - `phase-2/frontend/src/lib/api.ts`: Added 4 interfaces, updated 2 method signatures
   - `phase-2/frontend/src/app/history/page.tsx`: Fixed type imports and response handling
   - `phase-2/frontend/src/app/notifications/page.tsx`: Fixed type imports, field references, and added formatters

4. **Verification:**
   - Local build passed all TypeScript checks
   - Committed changes and pushed to trigger Vercel deployment
   - Vercel build succeeded in 21 seconds

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Fixed critical Vercel deployment blocker; all TypeScript errors resolved; application deployed to production
- 🧪 Tests: Next.js TypeScript compilation passed; all 11 pages generated successfully
- 📁 Files: 3 modified (api.ts, history/page.tsx, notifications/page.tsx); 70 insertions, 19 deletions
- 🔁 Next prompts: Monitor production for runtime issues; consider adding API response validation; add unit tests for type interfaces
- 🧠 Reflection: Type mismatches between frontend and backend are common when API responses evolve; proper TypeScript interfaces prevent runtime errors and improve developer experience

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Type inference issues when defensive coding (Array.isArray checks) conflicts with strict return types; incorrect assumptions about backend response structure; missing fields in TypeScript interfaces
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): TypeScript compilation (PASS), Next.js build (PASS), Vercel deployment (PASS)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - direct bug fix from build error logs
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add runtime validation using Zod or similar to catch response schema mismatches earlier; generate TypeScript types from OpenAPI spec to prevent drift
