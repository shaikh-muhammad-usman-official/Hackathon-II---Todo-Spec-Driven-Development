## Prompt

User provided Vercel build error log showing TypeScript compilation failure:

```
./src/app/dashboard/page.tsx:112:45
Type error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.

  112 |  <StatsCard label="Success Rate" value={Math.round(data.completion_rate * 100) / 100 + '%'} icon="completed" color="green" />
       |                                             ^
```

User message: "ye history prompt khud nhi bn rahi" (this history prompt is not being created automatically)

## Response snapshot

Fixed the TypeScript error by updating the StatsCard component interface to accept both number and string values:

**Changed:**
```typescript
interface StatsCardProps {
  label: string;
  value: number | string;  // Was: value: number;
  icon: 'total' | 'pending' | 'completed';
  color: 'cyan' | 'fuchsia' | 'green';
}
```

**Actions taken:**
1. Identified the issue: Dashboard was passing `"95.5%"` (string) to StatsCard which only accepted numbers
2. Updated StatsCard.tsx to accept `number | string` for the value prop
3. Committed the fix with proper message
4. Pushed to branch `1-phase2-advanced-features`
5. Created this PHR as requested by user

**Commit:** 564f7b7 - "fix: Allow string values in StatsCard for percentage display"

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Fixed Vercel build TypeScript error blocking deployment
- 🧪 Tests: None required - type-only change
- 📁 Files: Modified 1 file (StatsCard.tsx)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Monitor Vercel rebuild, verify deployment succeeds
- 🧠 Reflection: User noted PHRs not being auto-created - need to ensure PHR creation after each significant interaction

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: StatsCard component too restrictive on value type, preventing formatted percentage display
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): TypeScript compilation should now pass
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding a `suffix` prop to StatsCard for cleaner API instead of string concatenation
