## Response snapshot

Implemented T029-T033: Priority and Due Date UI Integration

TaskForm (T029-T030):
- Added priority selector (high/medium/low/none)
- Added DatePicker component with minDate validation
- Created "Advanced Options" toggle button
- Form submits priority and due_date to API

TaskItem (T031-T033):
- Added PriorityBadge component import
- Display priority badge next to task title
- Display due date with clock icon
- Overdue detection with red border and red text warning
- Conditional styling: completed (green), overdue (red), normal (cyan)

Backend Testing:
- Created test user via /api/auth/signup
- Authenticated via /api/auth/signin
- Created task with priority="high" and due_date="2026-01-05T12:00:00"
- Verified task list retrieval returns priority and due_date
- Confirmed past date validation works

Servers Running:
- Backend: http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI with SQLAlchemy)
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (Next.js 16.1.1 Turbopack)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Users can now set and see task priorities and due dates in the UI
- 🧪 Tests: API endpoints validated with curl - priority/due_date stored and retrieved correctly
- 📁 Files: 2 files modified - TaskForm.tsx (+60 lines), TaskItem.tsx (+25 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implement T034 (testing), continue with US2-US11 features
- 🧠 Reflection: Integration smooth - components work together with existing Phase 1 structure

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Frontend server startup took 45s due to Turbopack compilation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Backend API accepts and returns Phase 2 fields
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add visual indicator for tasks due today vs tomorrow vs overdue
