## Prompt

User's first message (Urdu): "history nhi bn rahi spec kit use nhi kr rahe ki?"
Translation: "History is not being created, are you not using spec kit?"

User's second message (Urdu): "spec bhi phase3 ke sahi nazar nhi aa rahe"
Translation: "Phase 3 specs also don't look correct"

User then provided: --title "Phase 3 ChatKit Implementation and Debugging" --stage implementation --feature phase-3-chatbot

Context: User noticed that:
1. PHR (Prompt History Records) were not being created for the conversation
2. Spec-Kit workflow was not being followed properly
3. Phase 3 specs appeared incorrect
4. Backend server was crashing with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'chatkit'"

## Response snapshot

I acknowledged the user's concern and immediately:
1. Fixed the backend crash by commenting out ChatKit SDK imports (SDK not publicly available yet)
2. Restarted the backend server successfully on port 8000
3. Initiated PHR creation process using Spec-Kit workflow
4. Identified that the chatkit-backend-engineer agent had created files importing unavailable SDK
5. Switched to using the working REST API implementation in routes/chat.py instead

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Backend server now running without errors; PHR workflow initiated; identified root cause of ChatKit SDK unavailability
- 🧪 Tests: Backend startup successful; all database tables loaded correctly (users, tasks, conversations, messages)
- 📁 Files: Modified phase-3/backend/main.py (commented out chatkit imports); created this PHR
- 🔁 Next prompts: "Verify Phase 3 specs are correct", "Implement working chat UI using REST API", "Add voice and Urdu support"
- 🧠 Reflection: The chatkit-backend-engineer agent created implementation files for an SDK that isn't publicly available yet. Should have verified SDK availability before implementation. User correctly identified that Spec-Kit workflow (PHR creation) was not being followed.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: (1) Agent created code importing unavailable SDK without verification, (2) PHR was not created proactively after significant work, (3) User had to explicitly request PHR creation, (4) Spec-Kit workflow not followed automatically
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Backend startup: PASS, Database connection: PASS, ChatKit SDK availability: FAIL (not available), PHR workflow adherence: FAIL (user had to request)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Always verify external SDK/package availability before generating implementation code; automatically create PHR after completing significant implementation or debugging work without user prompt
