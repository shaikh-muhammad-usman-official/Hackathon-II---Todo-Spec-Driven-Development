## Prompt

User executed `/sp.tasks` command to generate atomic task breakdown for Phase 2 Advanced Features implementation.

**Context**:
- Complete planning artifacts available (plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md)
- 11 user stories with priorities (P1: 3 stories, P2: 4 stories, P3: 4 stories)
- 13 features total (6 intermediate + 7 advanced)
- 5-agent subagent architecture (Backend → Features → UI → Analytics → Auth)
- Must follow SpecKit Plus task organization: independent user stories, testable increments

**Requirements**:
- Organize tasks by user story (Phase 3-13 = one phase per story)
- Each task must follow strict format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Include Setup (Phase 1) and Foundation (Phase 2) phases
- Identify dependencies and parallel opportunities
- Define MVP scope (minimal deliverable)
- Validate against success criteria from spec

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task breakdown with **206 atomic tasks** organized across **14 phases**:

### Task Organization Structure

**Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure** (8 tasks, ~2 hours)
- Install dependencies (backend: cron-validator, frontend: date-fns, chart.js, etc.)
- Create and run database migration
- Update configuration files (requirements.txt, package.json, tailwind.config.js)

**Phase 2: Foundation** (13 tasks, ~1 day)
- Extend Task model with 8 new fields (due_date, priority, tags, recurrence_pattern, etc.)
- Create 4 new models (TaskHistory, UserPreferences, Tag, Notification)
- Update database setup and API type definitions
- Create foundation hooks (useKeyboard, useNotifications)

**Phases 3-13: User Stories** (164 tasks, ~12-15 days)

Each user story phase includes:
1. Backend tasks (models, endpoints, services)
2. Frontend tasks (components, pages, UI integration)
3. API client updates

- Performance: Database indexes, pagination, virtual scrolling, bundle optimization
- Documentation: README, demo script, .env.example
- Testing: All 18 success criteria validation

### Key Metrics

- **Total Tasks**: 206
- **Parallelizable**: 58 tasks marked [P]
- **User Story Tasks**: 164 (organized by story)
- **Backend Tasks**: ~80 (endpoints, services, models)
- **Frontend Tasks**: ~110 (components, pages, hooks)
- **Infrastructure**: 21 (setup, foundation, polish)

### Task Format Validation

✅ **All 206 tasks follow strict format**:
- Checkbox: `- [ ]` (required)
- Task ID: T001-T206 (sequential)
- [P] marker: 58 tasks (parallelizable)
- [Story] label: 164 tasks (US1-US11)
- File paths: All tasks include specific locations

**Examples**:
- `- [ ] T001 Install backend dependencies: pip install cron-validator in phase-2/backend/`
- `- [ ] T027 [P] [US1] Create PriorityBadge component with color coding (red/yellow/green): phase-2/frontend/src/components/PriorityBadge.tsx`
- `- [ ] T050 [US3] Extend search endpoint with filter parameters (status, priority, tags, due_before, due_after): phase-2/backend/routes/tasks.py`

### Dependency Graph

**Critical Path**:
1. Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundation) → User Stories → Polish
2. Foundation blocks all user stories
3. User stories mostly independent (can run in parallel)

**User Story Dependencies**:
- **Independent** (no dependencies): US1, US2, US6, US9, US10
- **Dependent**:
  - US3 → requires US1 (priority) + US2 (tags) for filters
  - US4 → requires US1 (due dates)
  - US5 → requires US1 (due dates) + US4 (recurring)
  - US7 → requires US1 (priority data) for charts
  - US11 → requires US1, US2, US4 (all fields exportable)

**Recommended Order**:
1. Sprint 1 (MVP): Setup → Foundation → US1 → US2 (40 tasks, 3-4 days)
2. Sprint 2: US3 → US4 → US8 → US11 (79 tasks, 5-6 days)
3. Sprint 3: US5 → US6 → US7 → US9 → US10 → Polish (87 tasks, 5-6 days)

### Parallel Execution Strategy

**Foundation Phase**:
- T009-T013 (5 models) can run in parallel [P]
- T017-T018 (UI components) can run in parallel [P]
- T020-T021 (hooks) can run in parallel [P]

**Within User Stories**:
- Backend tasks must complete before frontend in same story
- But frontend tasks within a story often parallel (e.g., T027-T028 in US1)

**Across User Stories** (after Foundation):
- US1, US2, US6, US9, US10 → can be assigned to 5 different agents simultaneously
- US3, US4, US8, US11 → can start once their dependencies complete

**Agent Assignment**:
- **BackendAgent**: All backend tasks (T022-T026, T035-T040, T050-T054, etc.)
- **FeaturesAgent**: US1, US2, US4 frontend (due dates, tags, recurring)
- **UIAgent**: US3, US10 frontend (filtering, shortcuts)
- **AnalyticsAgent**: US6, US7, US11 frontend (history, charts, export)
- **AuthAgent**: US8, US9 frontend (settings, profile)

### MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product** (First Deliverable):
- Phase 1: Setup (8 tasks)
- Phase 2: Foundation (13 tasks)
- Phase 3: US1 - Task Organization (13 tasks)
- Phase 4: US2 - Task Categorization (15 tasks)

**Total MVP**: 49 tasks, estimated 3-4 days
**Value Delivered**: Users can create tasks with priorities and due dates, add tags, search and filter - core organization features working

### Success Criteria Mapping

Each user story phase includes acceptance criteria from spec.md:

- **US1**: Users can set priority and due date, see color-coded badges, overdue warnings
- **US2**: Full-text search works, tags autocomplete, click tag to filter
- **US3**: Multi-criteria filtering, sorting by 4 fields, filter summary bar
- **US4**: Recurring tasks auto-regenerate, recurring badge visible
- **US5**: Browser notifications appear at scheduled time, permission flow
- **US6**: Task history shows all modifications with timestamps
- **US7**: Analytics charts (completion rate, priority distribution, weekly activity)
- **US8**: Theme toggle instant, settings persist across sessions
- **US9**: Avatar upload works, displays in header, account stats visible
- **US10**: All 8 keyboard shortcuts functional, help modal with `?`
- **US11**: Export downloads JSON/CSV, import validates and restores data

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown with 206 atomic, testable tasks organized by user story for independent implementation; includes MVP scope (49 tasks), parallel opportunities (58 [P] tasks), and dependency graph showing critical path
- 🧪 Tests: Task format validation (all 206 follow checklist format), user story organization (11 stories mapped), dependency validation (critical path identified), parallel opportunities (58 tasks), MVP scope (US1+US2 = 49 tasks)
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md with 206 tasks across 14 phases)
- 🔁 Next prompts: "Start implementation with Phase 1 Setup", "Execute MVP (US1+US2)", "Assign user stories to subagents"
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown successfully balances atomicity (each task <4 hours) with meaningful increments (each user story is complete feature); organization by user story enables true independent implementation and testing; MVP scope (US1+US2) provides quick path to first deliverable (3-4 days) while full implementation parallelizable across 5 agents (8-10 days with parallelization vs 15-18 days sequential)

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all planning documents available, task generation followed strict format rules
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - ✅ PASS: All 206 tasks follow checkbox format with ID, optional [P], optional [Story], description, file path
  - ✅ PASS: Tasks organized by user story (Phases 3-13 map to US1-US11)
  - ✅ PASS: Each user story has independent test criteria (can implement and test standalone)
  - ✅ PASS: Dependencies documented (critical path: Setup → Foundation → Stories → Polish)
  - ✅ PASS: Parallel opportunities identified (58 [P] tasks across phases)
  - ✅ PASS: MVP scope defined (49 tasks for US1+US2, deliverable in 3-4 days)
  - ✅ PASS: File paths included for all tasks (specific locations in phase-2/backend/ and phase-2/frontend/)
  - ✅ PASS: Subagent mapping documented (Backend, Features, UI, Analytics, Auth agents assigned)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (first task breakdown for this feature)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute Phase 1 (Setup) tasks T001-T008 to install dependencies and run migration, then verify with Phase 2 (Foundation) model creation before starting MVP implementation (US1+US2)
