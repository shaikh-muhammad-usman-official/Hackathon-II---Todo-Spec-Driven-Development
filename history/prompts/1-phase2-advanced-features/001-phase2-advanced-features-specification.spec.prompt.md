## Prompt

User requested comprehensive Phase 2 Advanced Features specification including:

**INTERMEDIATE FEATURES:**
1. Due Dates & Time Pickers - Calendar integration, date/time selection
2. Priorities (High/Medium/Low) - Color-coded priority levels
3. Tags/Categories - Custom tags with filtering
4. Search - Full-text search across tasks
5. Filter - By status, priority, tags, dates
6. Sort - By due date, priority, title, created date

**ADVANCED FEATURES:**
7. Recurring Tasks - Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Custom patterns
8. Browser Notifications - Permission-based reminders
9. Task History - Activity log with timestamps
10. Analytics Dashboard - Charts for completion rates, priority distribution
11. User Settings - Preferences, theme, notification settings
12. User Profile - Avatar, name, email management
13. Keyboard Shortcuts - Vim-style navigation, quick actions

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Extend existing database schema (tasks table)
- Add new tables: tags, categories, task_history, user_preferences
- Implement notification worker service
- Calendar UI component with date picker
- Charts library integration (Chart.js/Recharts)
- Settings page with preference management
- Profile management page
- Search/filter/sort API endpoints

Follow hackathon.md Phase 2 requirements strictly.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification following SpecKit Plus workflow:

1. **Feature Branch Created**: `1-phase2-advanced-features`
   - First feature in the project using SpecKit Plus
   - Checked for existing branches (none found)

2. **Specification Written** (specs/1-phase2-advanced-features/spec.md):
   - 10 prioritized user stories organized by value:
     - P1 (Must-have): Task organization (due dates/priorities), categorization (tags/search), filtering/sorting
     - P2 (High-value): Recurring tasks, notifications, settings
     - P3 (Nice-to-have): History, analytics, profile, keyboard shortcuts
   - 32 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-032) covering all 13 features
   - Each user story includes:
     - Clear value proposition
     - Independent testability criteria
     - Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
   - 8 edge cases identified (timezone handling, permission management, performance at scale)
   - 4 key entities defined (Task Extended, TaskHistory, UserPreferences, Tag, Notification)
   - 12 measurable success criteria (response times, completion rates, usability metrics)

3. **Quality Validation** (specs/1-phase2-advanced-features/checklists/requirements.md):
   - All checklist items PASS ✅
   - Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   - No implementation details (technology-agnostic)
   - All requirements testable and unambiguous
   - Success criteria measurable and user-focused

4. **Specification Characteristics**:
   - Business-focused: Written for product managers, not developers
   - User-centric: All requirements tied to user value
   - Testable: Every FR has clear pass/fail criteria
   - Measurable: SC includes specific metrics (500ms search, 90% usability, 40% time reduction)
   - Incremental: P1→P2→P3 enables MVP-first delivery

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Phase 2 specification covering all 13 features from user request and hackathon.md Phase 2 requirements, organized into 10 prioritized user stories ready for planning
- 🧪 Tests: Specification validation checklist passes all criteria (content quality, requirement completeness, feature readiness)
- 📁 Files: 2 files created (spec.md with 32 FRs and 12 SCs, requirements.md checklist)
- 🔁 Next prompts: "/sp.clarify" if any requirements need refinement, "/sp.plan" to design implementation architecture
- 🧠 Reflection: Successful specification without any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers by making informed decisions based on hackathon.md requirements and industry-standard UX patterns; prioritization (P1/P2/P3) enables incremental delivery starting with core organizational features

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification completed without clarification needs by referencing hackathon.md Phase 2 requirements (lines 51-63) for intermediate/advanced feature definitions
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - ✅ PASS: All mandatory sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)
  - ✅ PASS: No implementation details present (no React, FastAPI, Chart.js mentioned in requirements)
  - ✅ PASS: All 32 functional requirements are testable with clear criteria
  - ✅ PASS: All 12 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
  - ✅ PASS: Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (specification is complete)
  - ✅ PASS: 8 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (first specification for this feature)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase (/sp.plan) to design implementation architecture; consider grouping features into phases (Phase 2A: intermediate features, Phase 2B: advanced features) if implementation scope is too large
