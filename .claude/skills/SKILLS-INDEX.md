# MJS Skills Library

> 22 agent skills encoding frozen decisions for software engineering workflows.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are **not documentation**. They encode:
- Judgment calls that took hours/days to figure out
- Gotchas that broke production
- Patterns that domain experts use but don't write down
- Tool combinations that work together

**The test:** Would you recreate this if deleted? If Claude already knows it, it's not a skill.

## For Claude: How to Use This Library

### When a Skill Should Trigger

1. **Check the description** - Contains "Use when [trigger]"
2. **Match user intent** - Not just keywords, but what they're trying to accomplish
3. **Verify exclusions** - Some skills say "NOT when [exclusion]"

### When NOT to Use a Skill

- User asks about something Claude already knows well
- The skill would add tokens without adding value
- Multiple skills could apply - pick the most specific one

### Skill Dependencies

Some skills work together:

```
User: "Deploy my Next.js app to Kubernetes"

1. containerizing-applications → Dockerfile, docker-compose
2. building-nextjs-apps → NEXT_PUBLIC_* build args
3. deploying-cloud-k8s → CI/CD, architecture matching
```

### Cross-References

Skills reference each other in "Related Skills" sections. Follow these when:
- User's task spans multiple domains
- One skill mentions another as prerequisite
- Troubleshooting requires adjacent knowledge

---

## For Humans: Contributing Skills

### Before Creating a Skill

Ask: **Does Claude need this?**

- If it's standard library usage → NO
- If it's well-documented patterns → NO
- If you spent hours debugging it → YES
- If production broke because of it → YES

### Skill Quality Checklist

- [ ] Has `Use when` trigger in description
- [ ] Under 500 lines / 5000 tokens
- [ ] Has `scripts/verify.py` that exits 0/1
- [ ] Includes battle-tested gotchas (not theory)
- [ ] References are one level deep only

### The Domain Expert Test

> Would a senior engineer in this domain say "yes, this captures what we actually do"?

Common failures:
- Tutorial-level content (Claude knows this)
- Missing edge cases experts handle automatically
- Idealized patterns that break in production
- Wrong tool choices for the scale

## Adding New Skills

When user throws ideas or skills:

### Evaluation Flow

```
User submits skill idea
        │
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Does Claude already know it? │──YES──► REJECT (not a skill)
└─────────────────────────────┘
        │ NO
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Did it cause production pain?│──YES──► HIGH PRIORITY
└─────────────────────────────┘
        │ NO
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Would expert recreate it?   │──YES──► MEDIUM PRIORITY
└─────────────────────────────┘
        │ NO
        ▼
      REJECT
```

### Merge vs New Skill

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Extends existing skill domain | Add to existing skill's references/ |
| New domain, similar trigger | Evaluate collision, pick clearer name |
| New domain, unique trigger | Create new skill |
| Overlaps multiple skills | Merge into most relevant, cross-reference |

### Enhancement Checklist

When enhancing existing skills to expert level:

1. **Search for production patterns** - What do experts actually use?
2. **Create references/*.md** - Deep patterns go here
3. **Update SKILL.md** - Add summary + link to reference
4. **Run verify.py** - Must still pass

### Skill Ideas Backlog

Areas with no skills yet:
- Database migrations at scale (Alembic, Drizzle patterns)
- Feature flags and gradual rollouts
- Incident response playbooks
- Observability instrumentation (OpenTelemetry)
- GraphQL federation patterns
- WebSocket scaling patterns
