# Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute with precision.

## Key Focus Areas

### Typography
Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt for distinctive choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

### Color & Theme
Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

### Motion
Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. CSS-only solutions for HTML. Motion library for React. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.

### Spatial Composition
Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
Create atmosphere and depth. Add gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders.

## NEVER Use

- Overused fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts
- Cliched colors: purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Predictable layouts and cookie-cutter patterns
- Designs that lack context-specific character

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist = elaborate code. Minimalist = restraint and precision.
